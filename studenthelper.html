                <div class="col">
                    <h4 class="text-center">What is it?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An app built for a class with fellow classmates that was built with the intent of helping other UTM students with features such as
                         a calendar, note taking, friends, timetable, and a map of the campus with food locations and times</li>
                        <li>This was built using mySQL, mongoDB, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, Java, jQuery, and Javascript along with
                         making use of REST endpoints to have interaction between our databases and client which was used for
                         the timetable for courses, calendar for dates, and for user information</li>
                        <li>Calendar lets you create dates with different importance like due dates, regular events, etc. along
                        with automatically placing class times on the calendar if enrolled in the timetable</li>
                        <li>Note taking allows taking notes as the name suggests but also allows you to save them for
                         later use, and then load them up again if needed</li>
                        <li>Timetable lets you enrol and unenrol in courses scraped from the UTM Timetable website with
                         courses being related to a certain session and semester so you will only see courses from the respective
                         session and semester, you are also able to upload your own timetable from the UofT website, and lastly
                         are able to have a cart of courses that you can then generate a timetable with smallest amount of gaps between courses</li>
                        <li>Map allows you to look at a map of the campus and see what respective food places are at each location and their times
                         it also is green if the store is open</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="col">
                    <h4 class="text-center">What did I do?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I worked on the timetable portion of the project mainly, with only a bit of work on some of the javascript
                         for the calendar</li>
                        <li>I worked on a scraping python script to scrape the courses from the <a href="https://student.utm.utoronto.ca/timetable/">UTM Timetable website</a>
                         and then place into our mongoDB database for later usage in the timetable</li>
                        <li>I also worked on the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the client side of the timetable which is using jQuery to POST or GET the information
                         needed and then using that information to do things such as display courses available for that session and semester, display a user's timetable
                         and enrol and unenrol from courses</li>
                        <li>More on the client side I did is the timetable generation cart section, so you are able to add to cart and remove from cart which
                         courses you would like to generate then send a request to generate your timetable which then auto enrols the generated times (I did not write the timetable generator part)</li>
                        <li>On the server side I worked on the endpoints such as displaying the courses which was written all in Java using Spring Boot linked to our
                         mongoDB database, and also the enroling / unenroliing server side so what controls a user's timetable and displaying the timetable</li>
