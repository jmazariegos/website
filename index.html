    <p id="home" class="visible">Hey! I'm Josh, a UofT 2020 Graduate, I graduated with an Honours Bachelors of Science in Information Security
        / Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics and currently working at Tata Consultancy Services as a QA Analyst.
        The type of work I like to do is usually with Java / Python or web based applications but generally I just like
        to try an learn anything that catches my eye so I dabble a little bit with lots of things not limited to coding.
        In terms of outside of coding I enjoy drawing, gaming, video editing, hanging out with friends, and learning new
        things! Thanks for visiting my page, and I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>An app built for a class with fellow classmates that was built with the intent of helping other UTM students with features such as
                        a calendar, note taking, friends, timetable, and a map of the campus with food locations and times</li>
                    <li>This was built using mySQL, mongoDB, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, Java, jQuery, and Javascript along with
                        making use of REST endpoints to have interaction between our databases and client which was used for
                        the timetable for courses, calendar for dates, and for user information</li>
                    <li>Calendar lets you create dates with different importance like due dates, regular events, etc. along
                        with automatically placing class times on the calendar if enrolled in the timetable</li>
                    <li>Note taking allows taking notes as the name suggests but also allows you to save them for
                        later use, and then load them up again if needed</li>
                    <li>Timetable lets you enrol and unenrol in courses scraped from the UTM Timetable website with
                        courses being related to a certain session and semester so you will only see courses from the respective
                        session and semester, you are also able to upload your own timetable from the UofT website, and lastly
                        are able to have a cart of courses that you can then generate a timetable with smallest amount of gaps between courses</li>
                    <li>Map allows you to look at a map of the campus and see what respective food places are at each location and their times
                        it also is green if the store is open</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I worked on the timetable portion of the project mainly, with only a bit of work on some of the javascript
                        for the calendar</li>
                    <li>I worked on a scraping python script to scrape the courses from the <a href="https://student.utm.utoronto.ca/timetable/">UTM Timetable website</a>
                        and then place into our mongoDB database for later usage in the timetable</li>
                    <li>I also worked on the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the client side of the timetable which is using jQuery to POST or GET the information
                        needed and then using that information to do things such as display courses available for that session and semester, display a user's timetable
                        and enrol and unenrol from courses</li>
                    <li>More on the client side I did is the timetable generation cart section, so you are able to add to cart and remove from cart which
                        courses you would like to generate then send a request to generate your timetable which then auto enrols the generated times (I did not write the timetable generator part)</li>
                    <li>On the server side I worked on the endpoints such as displaying the courses which was written all in Java using Spring Boot linked to our
                        mongoDB database, and also the enroling / unenroliing server side so what controls a user's timetable and displaying the timetable</li>

                    <li>A device fingerprinting authenticator API, built for a project course with fellow classmates with the intent of testing device fingerprinting as a
                        form of second factor authenticator where it is hassle free, and almost unnoticeable by the user</li>
                    <li>This was built using SQLite, React Native, Yarn, express.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Nodemailer where we use React Native to create a homepage
                        where you could register or log in, and then we have Yarn to create our server where the API works, using REST endpoints through express.js to do certain things such as
                        logging in, registering, and certain database queries through SQLite for example determining devices tied to an account, and also have scripts to send mail to emails
                        for confirmation and also to confirm identity through unique codes</li>
                    <li>When registering it would send you an email to confirm your registration and also run the fingerprinting script to register a computer with its
                        fingerprints so then you could check the fingerprints when you log in.</li>
                    <li>When logging in it would run the fingerprinting script and confirm that your fingerprints are similar with a threshold of 90% and if under the threshold
                        would log the new fingerprints that didn't match and email you to confirm that this attempt was you so then it can register a new computer with new fingerprints
                        to your account so that you can use it to log in without removing the other computer and its fingerprints</li>
                    <li>After logging in, you have the ability to remove devices tied to your account and also see which accounts are tied to you through database queries using SQLite and express.js
                        along with fingerprints we collect, so we can see the fingerprints that can be passed through</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I worked on the backend portion of the project so I worked with the database and the endpoints with a little bit on the React Native end for sending data
                        through the client to the server</li>
                    <li>For the database and endpoints I worked on the queries and relationships, such as creating a relationship for users, devices, fingerprints, and tokens then having queries
                        so given a user I could get a list of devices or create a expirable token for users so they can confirm their identity through their email</li>
                    <li>Along with that I worked on the script for sending and email and creating a token for when you attempt to log in from another device, which was using nodemailer
                        and crypto, nodemailer was used to send the email through a gmail account that we owned, and using crypto to generate a unique token which then gets registered
                        in our database to a user with a expire time and if they can put their token in before it expires it will do device registering and all</li>

                    <li>The AI is meant to learn from losses in 3x3 squares and use that knowledge to try to win, only leverage it has is basic logic i.e. 3x3 with 1 square and only 1s meaning that has to be a bomb</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="col">
                <h4>What did I do?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I created the entire minesweeper game from scratch in javascript along with the AI, the visuals were all created by me as well</li>
                    <li>The game was done using clickable images where the board is created by the createBoard function which places the amount of tiles specified and then randomly places
                        the amount of bombs for the game but avoiding where it was clicked to avoid losing immediately and the buttons when clicked to a recursive function to check whether the
                        next tiles around are empty and if they are continue checking around them until they hit a tile with a bomb near it which then marks that tile with the number of
                        bombs near it</li>
                    <li>The timer is done using a timer interval same with the placing the flag down with left click but can also be done instantly with right click, technically you can
                        make a board of any size but for limiting (and other reasons) I have limited it to the normal amount, the reset button is the face and will always create the board with
                        the settings that are there</li>
                    <li>The AI on the other hand was made with a reinforcement learning method in mind so its a 3 layer AI with the input layer as the full board, the hidden layer as the
                        3x3 squares that are on the board, and the output layer as the single tile from the 3x3 square, and the hidden layer is made up of only one version of each 3x3 square
                        so that each board influences the probability of a 3x3 square by making it easier to determine its value, routing to output, and smaller size for AI</li>
                    <li>When the AI starts it adds the current board into the network then adds all new 3x3 squares within the board and attaches any existing 3x3 squares in the network to
                        the board with the corresponding positions of each tile in the 3x3 square to the full board (real position on board) and the connection from the 3x3 square to the tile containing the position of
                        the tile in 3x3 square (relative position)</li>
                    <li>The probabilities start at an equal level for each tile that isn't revealed yet so a new 3x3 square with 3 unrevealed tiles will have each tile with a probability of 1/3 of being a bomb
                        and depending on what the percentage reward is, it will increase tiles that have not been a bomb (while decreasing the others), or decrease them (and vice versa) which happens through
                        a backward pass if the tile is a bomb or not and the forward pass finds the tile with the highest probability</li>
                    <li>Lastly the AI has settings for making it do runs on its own so it can get trained and the delay if you want to watch it, which is still in development for the time being</li>
                    <li>Bonus! I noticed that the AI was really bad at learning with no prior knowledge so I attempted to give it a little leverage by giving it some basic logic of where bombs MUST be
                        so spots where it has to be, it will already know by using a function and using the faces of the tiles already seen</li>

                <h4>What is it?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a research project I did with a professor and my classmates in my final year, the goal
                    of the project was to create a self-driving car then create scenarios where the car would not be able
                    to properly make a decision in order to show potential flaws within self-driving technology that can
                    then be used to help avoid those scenarios.</li>
                    <li>We were able to create the self-driving car using a remote car equipped with a liDAR, RGBD camera,
                    and a small computer running Ubuntu, it first begun using a PID Control to create the dataset which
                    would be used to train the neural network while it worked for our room, in our campus, the building we were using had glass
                    fence and windows in the hallways causing the liDAR to be unable to guess how far the wall actually was, making the dataset
                    more unreliable, so we switched to using a controller and driving it in the way we would want it to
                    drive.</li>
                    <li>Afterwards we would trained the NVIDIA network based on our dataset to have the car create the
                    decisions, so we had to re-weigh some values such as turning since compared to the going straight
                    data we had, we needed it to properly weigh the turning data so turning is prioritized during turns
                    rather than going straight.</li>
                    <li>In order to see it moving live and decision making as it was driving, we had implemented a DASH/Flask
                    website hosted on the computer on the remote car which would store and create live graphs of the angle and
                    time data so when it would make a strange decision we could see when and why it happened, helping
                    us work on it faster along with a remote command terminal to control the car's server and network.</li>
                    <li>As a sad final note, the pandemic had started during the final months of our research project so
                    we weren't able to work on the create scenarios where our car would fail because of the school being
                    moved to remote learning and no students allowed on the campus unless you live there, making it
                    much harder to work on it.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="col">
                <h4>What did I do?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I helped with working on the neural network, creating the DASH/Flask server, and a few
                    experimental testing choices.</li>
                    <li>Regarding the neural network what I worked on was helping the decision making and weighing of the
                    network because when we realized that the data heavily prioritized going straight because for a majority
                    of the data the car is going straight so turning left and right was weighted less, so I helped in determining
                    how to adjust our weight function so that we would correctly weigh the data in order for our remote car
                    to properly drive through our campus building's hallways.</li>
                    <li>In regards with the DASH/Flask server, I created the server using Flask and REST then using DASH to create
                    the graphs which would be updated live and recorded so that we could review the data as it happens or if we
                    need it later.</li>
                    <li>I used REST in order for the website to receive live data, so it would send the time of decision and angle
                    of the car which would then be input into the current CSV file for the run then have DASH update based
                    on the CSV we just updated using a DASH callback function, while also including tools such as pausing the graph
                    update in case we need to look at a specific time while it stays updating or resetting the graph for new data / run.</li>
                    <li>Final use for the FLASK server was a remote terminal just using REST, SYSTEM, and a terminal sandbox iframe made by
                    <a href="https://github.com/ethanhuang0526">ethanhuang0526</a> which would take your command from the terminal
                    then send it to the server on the remote car to then execute commands such as starting the network or working
                    on it as it is driving, as before that we could only work on it when we hooked the car up to the monitor in
                    our room.</li>
                    <li>Continuing with the decision making and experimental testing, I helped to implement PyTorch's floor segmentation
                    to then feed the car only data of the floor so then the car would only need the floor to know what decision
                    to make, and we were able to segment the floor from test data images but unfortunately we weren't able to put
                    the data to the test as pandemic had started making using the remote car more difficult.</li>

                     using JQuery for easier element changes such as disabling all clickable buttons / dropdowns and using them to change animation
                     classes for page changes</li>
                    <li>CSS is used to do the animations and are tied to classes so that when the page changes the relevant elements start doing
                     animation by having animations for fading out and fading in mixed with the timeout function to make sure the animations
                     look smooth and everything is gone before replacing</li>
