    <p id="home" class="visible">Hey! I'm Josh, a UofT 2020 Graduate, I graduated with an Honours Bachelors of Science in Information Security
        / Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics and currently working at Tata Consultancy Services as a QA Analyst.
        The type of work I like to do is usually with Java / Python or web based applications but generally I just like
        to try an learn anything that catches my eye so I dabble a little bit with lots of things not limited to coding.
        In terms of outside of coding I enjoy drawing, gaming, video editing, hanging out with friends, and learning new
        things! Thanks for visiting my page, and I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>An app built for a class with fellow classmates that was built with the intent of helping other UTM students with features such as
                        a calendar, note taking, friends, timetable, and a map of the campus with food locations and times</li>
                    <li>This was built using mySQL, mongoDB, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, Java, jQuery, and Javascript along with
                        making use of REST endpoints to have interaction between our databases and client which was used for
                        the timetable for courses, calendar for dates, and for user information</li>
                    <li>Calendar lets you create dates with different importance like due dates, regular events, etc. along
                        with automatically placing class times on the calendar if enrolled in the timetable</li>
                    <li>Note taking allows taking notes as the name suggests but also allows you to save them for
                        later use, and then load them up again if needed</li>
                    <li>Timetable lets you enrol and unenrol in courses scraped from the UTM Timetable website with
                        courses being related to a certain session and semester so you will only see courses from the respective
                        session and semester, you are also able to upload your own timetable from the UofT website, and lastly
                        are able to have a cart of courses that you can then generate a timetable with smallest amount of gaps between courses</li>
                    <li>Map allows you to look at a map of the campus and see what respective food places are at each location and their times
                        it also is green if the store is open</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I worked on the timetable portion of the project mainly, with only a bit of work on some of the javascript
                        for the calendar</li>
                    <li>I worked on a scraping python script to scrape the courses from the <a href="https://student.utm.utoronto.ca/timetable/">UTM Timetable website</a>
                        and then place into our mongoDB database for later usage in the timetable</li>
                    <li>I also worked on the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the client side of the timetable which is using jQuery to POST or GET the information
                        needed and then using that information to do things such as display courses available for that session and semester, display a user's timetable
                        and enrol and unenrol from courses</li>
                    <li>More on the client side I did is the timetable generation cart section, so you are able to add to cart and remove from cart which
                        courses you would like to generate then send a request to generate your timetable which then auto enrols the generated times (I did not write the timetable generator part)</li>
                    <li>On the server side I worked on the endpoints such as displaying the courses which was written all in Java using Spring Boot linked to our
                        mongoDB database, and also the enroling / unenroliing server side so what controls a user's timetable and displaying the timetable</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A device fingerprinting authenticator API, built for a project course with fellow classmates with the intent of testing device fingerprinting as a
                        form of second factor authenticator where it is hassle free, and almost unnoticeable by the user</li>
                    <li>This was built using SQLite, React Native, Yarn, express.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Nodemailer where we use React Native to create a homepage
                        where you could register or log in, and then we have Yarn to create our server where the API works, using REST endpoints through express.js to do certain things such as
                        logging in, registering, and certain database queries through SQLite for example determining devices tied to an account, and also have scripts to send mail to emails
                        for confirmation and also to confirm identity through unique codes</li>
                    <li>When registering it would send you an email to confirm your registration and also run the fingerprinting script to register a computer with its
                        fingerprints so then you could check the fingerprints when you log in.</li>
                    <li>When logging in it would run the fingerprinting script and confirm that your fingerprints are similar with a threshold of 90% and if under the threshold
                        would log the new fingerprints that didn't match and email you to confirm that this attempt was you so then it can register a new computer with new fingerprints
                        to your account so that you can use it to log in without removing the other computer and its fingerprints</li>
                    <li>After logging in, you have the ability to remove devices tied to your account and also see which accounts are tied to you through database queries using SQLite and express.js
                        along with fingerprints we collect, so we can see the fingerprints that can be passed through</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I worked on the backend portion of the project so I worked with the database and the endpoints with a little bit on the React Native end for sending data
                        through the client to the server</li>
                    <li>For the database and endpoints I worked on the queries and relationships, such as creating a relationship for users, devices, fingerprints, and tokens then having queries
                        so given a user I could get a list of devices or create a expirable token for users so they can confirm their identity through their email</li>
                    <li>Along with that I worked on the script for sending and email and creating a token for when you attempt to log in from another device, which was using nodemailer
                        and crypto, nodemailer was used to send the email through a gmail account that we owned, and using crypto to generate a unique token which then gets registered
                        in our database to a user with a expire time and if they can put their token in before it expires it will do device registering and all</li>

                    <li>The AI is meant to learn from losses in 3x3 squares and use that knowledge to try to win, only leverage it has is basic logic i.e. 3x3 with 1 square and only 1s meaning that has to be a bomb</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="col">
                <h4>What did I do?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I created the entire minesweeper game from scratch in javascript along with the AI, the visuals were all created by me as well</li>
                    <li>The game was done using clickable images where the board is created by the createBoard function which places the amount of tiles specified and then randomly places
                        the amount of bombs for the game but avoiding where it was clicked to avoid losing immediately and the buttons when clicked to a recursive function to check whether the
                        next tiles around are empty and if they are continue checking around them until they hit a tile with a bomb near it which then marks that tile with the number of
                        bombs near it</li>
                    <li>The timer is done using a timer interval same with the placing the flag down with left click but can also be done instantly with right click, technically you can
                        make a board of any size but for limiting (and other reasons) I have limited it to the normal amount, the reset button is the face and will always create the board with
                        the settings that are there</li>
                    <li>The AI on the other hand was made with a reinforcement learning method in mind so its a 3 layer AI with the input layer as the full board, the hidden layer as the
                        3x3 squares that are on the board, and the output layer as the single tile from the 3x3 square, and the hidden layer is made up of only one version of each 3x3 square
                        so that each board influences the probability of a 3x3 square by making it easier to determine its value, routing to output, and smaller size for AI</li>
                    <li>When the AI starts it adds the current board into the network then adds all new 3x3 squares within the board and attaches any existing 3x3 squares in the network to
                        the board with the corresponding positions of each tile in the 3x3 square to the full board (real position on board) and the connection from the 3x3 square to the tile containing the position of
                        the tile in 3x3 square (relative position)</li>
                    <li>The probabilities start at an equal level for each tile that isn't revealed yet so a new 3x3 square with 3 unrevealed tiles will have each tile with a probability of 1/3 of being a bomb
                        and depending on what the percentage reward is, it will increase tiles that have not been a bomb (while decreasing the others), or decrease them (and vice versa) which happens through
                        a backward pass if the tile is a bomb or not and the forward pass finds the tile with the highest probability</li>
                    <li>Lastly the AI has settings for making it do runs on its own so it can get trained and the delay if you want to watch it, which is still in development for the time being</li>
                    <li>Bonus! I noticed that the AI was really bad at learning with no prior knowledge so I attempted to give it a little leverage by giving it some basic logic of where bombs MUST be
                        so spots where it has to be, it will already know by using a function and using the faces of the tiles already seen</li>
